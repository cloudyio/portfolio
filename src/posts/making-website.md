## Introduction
I had tried a couple of times prior to this to make a website, but nothing stuck. Around 3 or so tries later, I made this website, which is something I am relatively happy with.

## Journey

### Starting out
Firstly, I thought the website had to be completely flashy and over the top to attract attention. This led me to go around looking at some other websites to try and find some ideas.

### Begining to create the websiteu
After seeing something I liked, I then tried [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for the first time to create a mockup of what I wanted.

### Final Result
In the end, I ended up with this:

It was ok but i didnt really like it and lost motivation soon after starting to actually develop the website.

### 2nd website
A while after i ended up designing a couple new websites which turned out like this:

![Mockup 2](/cdn/mockup2.png)

![Mockup 3](/cdn/mockup3.png)

These in general looked nice but werent great to actually develop and make everything feel right, these were too complicated so i ended up leaving these aswell

### Begining to simplify

Recently I realised that there wasnt really a need to make it flashy, in reality all it needs to do is display data.

After looking around a bit and designing i ended up with this:

Personally, i loved the style of the website and actually ended up building it in a day due to how simple it was, but there wasnt really a point in it.

There was no actual infomation on the website appart from a username and a couple social links, pretty much a more professional linktree unless you go to the other pages on the website.

### Finally

I ended up with the website you are looking at right now! im happy with how it turned out and like the color theme much more than the blue from before.
